    "This idea can be expressed mathematically. The probability (p) of finding a word with a certain property (such as the letter A) can be calculated by dividing the total number of words containing A (represented as MA) by the number of all words (M). So p = MA / M. At the same time, the information (I), meaning “The word contains an A,” reduces the space of all possibilities (M) by the factor ½I. We can present that as MA = ½I x M.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inserting both equations into each other, one can conclude with a formula that combines information content and probability: p = ½I x M / M, so p = ½I. This can also be reversed and solved for I: I = –log2p."
